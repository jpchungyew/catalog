# Item Catalog
Item Catalog project for Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree from Udacity

## Getting Started
Install [Vagrant](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://vagrantup.com/&sa=D&ust=1562760712425000) and [VirtualBox](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.virtualbox.org/&sa=D&ust=1562760712425000).

Follow these [instructions provided by Udacity](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud088/vagrant&sa=D&ust=1562760712425000).

Using the terminal, change directory to /vagrant (cd /vagrant), then type ```vagrant up``` to launch your virtual machine.

Once it is up and running, type ```vagrant ssh``` to log into it. This will log your terminal in to the virtual machine, and you'll get a Linux shell prompt. When you want to log out, type ```exit``` at the shell prompt.  To turn the virtual machine off (without deleting anything), type ```vagrant halt```. If you do this, you'll need to run vagrant up again before you can log into it. Be sure to change to the /vagrant directory by typing cd /vagrant in order to share files between your home machine and the VM. 

Clone this repository to your vagrant directory.
